The progress made in multitalker mixed speech separation and recognition, often referred to as the "cocktail-party problem", has been less impressive. Although human listeners can easily perceive separate sources in an acoustic mixture, the same task seems to be extremely difficult for computers, especially when only a single microphone recording the mixed-speech.

## 1. Speration Performance
Notice: The training set and the validation set that contain two-speaker mixtures generated by randomly selecting speakers and utterances from the WSJ0 set, and mixing them at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) uniformly chosen between -2.5 dB and 2.5 dB. <br>

The separation performance of **LSTM** are as follows:

Gender Combination | SDR | SAR | SIR | STOI | ESTOI | PESQ 
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Overall| 6.453328 | 9.372059 | 11.570311 | 0.473229 | 0.377204 | 1.5812
Male & Female | 8.238905 | 9.939668 | 14.531649 | 0.488542 | 0.393999 | 1.663442
Female & Female | 3.538810 | 8.134054 | 7.230494 | 0.459762 | 0.363213 | 1.478075
Male & Male | 5.011563 | 9.026763 | 9.000010 | 0.456667 | 0.358757 | 1.602058

The separation performance of **BLSTM** are as follows:

Gender Combination | SDR | SAR | SIR | STOI | ESTOI | PESQ 
:-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
Overall| 9.177447 | 10.629142 | 16.116564 | 0.536987 | 0.429255 | 1.65339
Male & Female | 10.647645 | 11.691969 | 18.203052 | 0.521656 | 0.421868 | 1.731112
Female & Female | 7.309365 | 9.393608 | 13.355384 | 0.560099 | 0.441704 | 1.553452
Male & Male | 7.797448 | 9.589827 | 14.198003 | 0.550071 | 0.435083 | 1.675609

From above results we can see that the separation effect of mixed gender audio is better than that of the same gender and BLSTM performs better than LSTM.

## 2. Evaluation Criterion
* SDR: Signal to Distortion Ratio
* SAR: Signal to Artifact Ratio
* SIR: Signal to Interference Ratio
* STOI: Short Time Objective Intelligibility Measure
* ESTOI: Extended Short Time Objective Intelligibility Measure
* PESQ: Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality

## 3. Dependency Library
* [librosa](https://librosa.github.io/)
* matlab (my test version: R2016b 64-bit)
* tensorflow (my test version: 1.4.0)
* anaconda3 (Python3.5+)

## 4. Usage Process
#### Generate Mixed and Target Speech:
When you have WSJ0 data, you can use the code "create-speaker-mixtures-V1/V2" to create the mixed speech. We mixed 2-speaker audios with samplerate 8000.

#### Run the command line script:
```bash
bash run.sh
```
which contains three steps:
1. Extract STFT features, and convert them to the tfrecords format of Tensorflow.
The training data is ready here. The file structure of training data is now as follows:
